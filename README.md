### Install Zot

Zot is an OCI package registry. Zot is used on your local system as a
pull-through cache for all artifacts that are not being changed locally as part
of development process.

instructions](https://zotregistry.dev/v2.1.0/install-guides/install-guide-linux/#installation)

The installation instructions above are for the most part distribution
agnostic. Some of the configuration files mentioned in the link are below:

This file:
* creates a registry with data in `/tmp/zot`
* runs a localhost only server on port 30000, depending on your use case you
  might want to have it bind to 0.0.0.0.
* mirrors everything from the githedgehog github repo

### Just push

The fabricator repo uses a [justfile][justfile1] for building and deploying code. After
you have made changes to your code, use
`just oci=http push` to build and push your code. All OCI artifacts will be
versioned using the [version string in tools.just][justfile2]
and will be pushed to the zot registry on the local machine, the new binaries will be created in `./bin/`

[justfile1]: https://github.com/githedgehog/fabricator/blob/21154b09112bdf148957dc75f2ce46d5be7beca0/justfile

### hhfab

If the code you are changing deals with setting up or managing flatcar, hhfab
will need to be instructed to pull packages from the local zot registry and not
the Github container registry (ghcr.io), pass the `--registry-repo 127.0.0.1:30000` 
flag and argument to `hhfab init` along with other flags. From there continue
 on with the `hhfab` commands. To get vlab running with local changes:

* `hhfab init --dev --registry-repo 127.0.0.1:30000`
* `hhfab vlab gen`
* `hhfab vlab up --mode iso`

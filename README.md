## Updating 3rd-party artifacts

### Flatcar Linux

```bash
wget "https://stable.release.flatcar-linux.net/amd64-usr/current/flatcar_production_qemu_image.img"
wget "https://stable.release.flatcar-linux.net/amd64-usr/current/flatcar_production_qemu_uefi_efi_code.fd"
wget "https://stable.release.flatcar-linux.net/amd64-usr/current/flatcar_production_qemu_uefi_efi_vars.fd"

mv flatcar_production_qemu_image.img flatcar.img
mv flatcar_production_qemu_uefi_efi_code.fd flatcar_efi_code.fd
mv flatcar_production_qemu_uefi_efi_vars.fd flatcar_efi_vars.fd

ls -lah

oras push ghcr.io/githedgehog/flatcar:VERSION flatcar*
```

`VERSION` is the version of the image, e.g. `2605.12.0`, taken from "stable" at https://www.flatcar.org/releases

### K3s

```bash
wget "https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/releases/download/v1.29.1%2Bk3s2/k3s"
wget "https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/releases/download/v1.29.1%2Bk3s2/k3s-airgap-images-amd64.tar.gz"
wget "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/k3s-io/k3s/v1.29.1%2Bk3s2/install.sh"

mv install.sh k3s-install.sh

ls -lah

oras push ghcr.io/githedgehog/k3s:v1.29.1-k3s2 k3s*
```

`VERSION` is the version of the K3s with `+` replaced with `-`. E.g. `1.29.1-k3s1`

### Grafana Alloy

Download latest version for linux x86_64, unpack and rename binary to `alloy`.

```bash
oras push ghcr.io/githedgehog/fabric/alloy:v1.0.0 alloy
```

### Proxy chart

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/tarampampam/3proxy:1.9.1
docker tag ghcr.io/tarampampam/3proxy:1.9.1 ghcr.io/githedgehog/fabric/fabric-proxy:1.9.1
docker push ghcr.io/githedgehog/fabric/fabric-proxy:1.9.1
```

## Steps to setup on ubuntu 22.04

I recommend using tmux or byobu. Byobu is already installed in Ubuntu and you can activate it for all sessions by

```
byobu-enable
```

and when you'll log back, you'll be in it already.

You'd need to have docker installed:

```
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o install-docker.sh
sudo sh install-docker.sh
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
newgrp docker
```

If you're running in the lab login into the registry mirror with user `lab` and regular lab password:

```
docker login https://m.l.hhdev.io:31000
```

Install some deps

```
sudo apt update
// optional: sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install -y qemu-kvm swtpm-tools tpm2-tools socat
sudo usermod -aG kvm $USER
newgrp kvm
kvm-ok
```

Good output:

```
ubuntu@sl-hhfab-test-01:~$ kvm-ok
INFO: /dev/kvm exists
KVM acceleration can be used
```

Tips:

```
socat -,raw,echo=0,escape=0x1d unix-connect:.hhfab/vlab-vms/switch-1/serial.sock
```



// TODO(user): Add simple overview of use/purpose

## Description
// TODO(user): An in-depth paragraph about your project and overview of use

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster
1. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/
```

2. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/fabricator:tag
```

3. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/fabricator:tag
```

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Contributing
// TODO(user): Add detailed information on how you would like others to contribute to this project

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/).

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/),
which provide a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources until the desired state is reached on the cluster.

### Test It Out
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
